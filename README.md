# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is compute the data and and create a summary report for the that shows the following in regards to the city type:
1) Total rides taken in each city type
2) Total count of drivers
3) Total fares
4) Average fair per ride
5) Average fare per driver
After computing all of the following above, the next purpose of this analysis is to compare the sum of fares for each weeks by city type.

# Result
**Ride-Sharing Summary Dataframe**

Result of the ride sharing summary shows that the total rides taken in urban area is disproportionally higher then suburban and rural. This explains why there are less drivers count in rural and suburban in comparison to the urban driver count and total fares. However, if we look at average fare per ride and average fare per driver for all three city type, it is significantly lower in urban in comparison to the rest two city types which I beleive is because of the number of drivers and total rides.

When we analyze the data by the sum of the fares for each city type on weekly basis and plot it in the multiple line graph for comparison, it shows that during first week of January the sum of fares is lowest for all city type which I think can be attribute to the weather. Since it's winter people do not want to commute a lot. As the  months progresses the sum of fares starts to pick up and but is volatile of for urban in end of Febrauray to end of March. The sum of fares plummets from end of February to first week of March and remains steady for suburban and rural city type but sales make "V" shaped recovery after every other week. 

**Recommendations**
On base of the result from both summary dataframe and multiple line plots of weekly total fare by city type, I would make a recommendation to the CEO to provide promotion to the suburban and city type because total number of drivers in urban and suburban city type accounts for only 3% and 16% of the total whereas total fares accounts for rural and suburban city types accounts for 7% and 30% respectively. To me this shows that price of a ride is higher in rural and suburban. So, promotions whould give incentive for riders to take ride without impacting drivers.

Another recommendation I would make is adapt more dynamic pricing competitive to the competitors which will increase the fare thus increase the earnings for the drivers and increase the profit for the company simultaneously.

Final recommendation I would make to the CEO is to focus more on suburban city type beacause currently suburban total fare accounts for 30% of total fares and 60% of urban areas. I would also recommend taking look at competitors and see where the opportunities lies geographically and come up with strategy to increase market share by analyzing our current market share.
